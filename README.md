I am a game designer with 8 years of professional experience building systems, analyzing data, and shipping live products. After years of solving complex problems and collaborating across teams to deliver secure and scalable experiences, I am transitioning into cybersecurity. I am actively developing my skills through hands on labs, security research, and practical training, with a focus on threat detection, incident response, and defensive security operations. I am specifically pursuing opportunities within a Security Operations Center as a Tier 1 Analyst or any entry level role where I can contribute immediately, continue learning, and build a strong foundation in security operations.
